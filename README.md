# Document-Classifier

# Overview
Document classification or document categorization is a problem in library science, information science and computer science. The task is to assign a document to one or more classes or categories.In this problem I have trained multiple ml models,LSTM and BERT.This document classification app will able to classify the documents into 9 categories.The 9 categories are:
- computer
- science
- politics
- sport
- automobile
- religion
- medicine
- sales
- alt.atheism
